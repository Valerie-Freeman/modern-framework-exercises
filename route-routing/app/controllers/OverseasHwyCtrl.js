Once an old railroad, the Highway is now considered one of the most exotic drives in the US, surrounded by coral reefs, swaying palm trees, savannah-like flora and fauna, waterside mangroves, and colorful sunsets. Stop at any of the islands along the way, or make the entire 113-mile trip from Miami to Key West, an achievable drive in four hours.";
